# MO Marketplace – Fullstack Take-Home Assignment (Flutter + Mock Node.js Backend)

This repository is my submission for the MO Marketplace Mobile Application Developer take-home assignment.

The goal is to deliver a clean, modern mobile UI with strong code structure, responsive design, and a scalable architecture.  
**I’m developing the solution incrementally with small commits to reflect real-world engineering workflow.** Also per each step I will add an entry to this Readme.md so my ususal development pattern may reflect with a glance. 

---

## What I am going to include at the submittion(Scope) 
 
### Core Requirements
- Home screen redesign (header/banner, categories, featured products + UX improvements)
- Product list page (at least 6 dummy products: image, title, price)
- Product details page (image, name, price, description)
- UX/UI improvement document (pain points + solutions + suggested flows)

### Bonus Targets (If time permits)
- Animations / page transitions
- Dark mode
- Reusable widgets
- Mock API layer

- Additionally I am planing to include these
  - A dummy level Node.js backend created for this. it will serve the app.

  - **TODO** (I will incrementally update this once I add a significant feature apart of above)

---

## Repository Structure
- `mobile-frontend/` – Flutter mobile app 
- `backend/` – Mock Node.js backend (planned; will provide local API + local image hosting)
---

## Development Approach
- Build step-by-step with small commits to reflect my knowladge.
- Use **Provider** for state management since it is simple.
- Keep UI modular with reusable widgets and clear separation of concerns.

---

## Progress Log (will be updated)
- [x] Repository initialized with Flutter mobile frontend
- [x] .gitignore created and relevent init entries included to it.
- [x] Readme.md markdown is added. Planing to document progress in it.

## Getting Started (Mobile)
